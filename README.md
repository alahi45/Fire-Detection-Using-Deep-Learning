## üìù Project Overview

This repository contains the code for an AI-powered fire detection model. The primary goal is to leverage computer vision and deep learning to create a system that can instantly identify fires from a standard camera feed. By using a pre-trained model (MobileNetV2), this project achieves high accuracy, making it a viable proof-of-concept for modern fire safety solutions.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Traditional fire detection systems like smoke and heat sensors are effective but require physical proximity to a fire, leading to potentially critical delays. This is especially true for large open areas or outdoor environments. The objective of this project is to overcome this limitation by creating a vision-based system that can detect fires from a distance, providing a faster, more versatile monitoring solution.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Image Classification:** Classifies any given image as containing 'Fire' or 'No Fire'.
- **Video Processing:** Analyzes video files frame-by-frame to detect fire in real-time.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves over 98% accuracy on the validation set.
- **Robust Model:** Built using transfer learning to generalize well to new, unseen images.

## üß† Methodology

The model was developed following a standard data science workflow:

### 1. Dataset
The model was trained on a public dataset from Kaggle containing ~1,000 images, balanced between two classes:
- `fire_images`
- `non_fire_images`

**Data augmentation** (random rotations, zooms, flips) was heavily applied to the training set to improve the model's robustness and prevent overfitting.

### 2. Model Architecture
This project employs **transfer learning** with the **MobileNetV2** architecture, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The core convolutional layers of MobileNetV2 were frozen, and custom classification layers were added on top. This approach leverages the powerful feature extraction capabilities of a state-of-the-art model and fine-tunes it for our specific task.

### 3. Training
The model was trained for 15 epochs using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. The training was conducted in a Google Colab environment, leveraging its free GPU resources.

## üìä Results

The model's performance was evaluated using several key metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness.

- **Accuracy:** >98%
- **AUC Score:** 0.99

#### Training History
The training and validation curves for accuracy and loss show stable learning with no significant overfitting.
